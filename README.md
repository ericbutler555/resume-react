# My Resume

Simple single-page app (SPA) built with plain React JS to serve as my online resume.

## Tech Stack

- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling
- Local `JSON` files for simple, separated data

I also made an [Angular version](https://github.com/ericbutler555/resume-ng) of this same resume if you're into that.
